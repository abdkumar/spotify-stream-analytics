# Setup Kafka VM
We will setup Kafka and data generator in a dedicated compute instance. Python Data Generator script will communicate with port 9092 of the broker container of Kafka to send/produce sptofy stream events.

- Establish SSH connection
SSH into the VM using username and public ip address
```bash
ssh user@ipaddress
```

- Clone git repo and cd into Kafka folder
```bash
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade && \
sudo apt-get install vim && \
sudo apt-get install git && \
git clone https://github.com/abdkumar/spotify-stream-analytics.git
```

- Install docker & docker-compose
```bash
bash ~/spotify-stream-analytics/scripts/vm_setup.sh && \
exec newgrp docker
```
- Check Docker Installation
```bash
docker version && \
docker compose version
```

- Set environment variable, External IP of the Kafka VM

```bash
export KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS=IP.ADDRESS
```
- Set environment variable, Kafka Topic Name of your interest (Ex: spotify)
```bash
export KAFKA_EVENTS_TOPIC=TOPIC_NAME
```

- Start Kafka
```bash
bash ~/spotify-stream-analytics/scripts/kafka_setup.sh && \ 
docker ps
``` 
**Note**: In case `docker ps` is not showing `kafka` and `zookeeper` containers. You should just stop all the containers with `docker compose down` and then rerun bash script.


- check topic created or not
```bash
docker container exec broker kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server broker:29092
```

- Open another terminal session for the Kafka VM and start sending messages to your Kafka broker with python script
