# Collection, Dashboard and Questions

Metabase organizes your data and analysis into three key components: collections, dashboards, and questions. Each plays a crucial role in enabling efficient data exploration and visualization.

#### Collections:

Act as organizational units for grouping related dashboards and questions.
Offer flexible access control, allowing you to restrict who can view and edit the contents.
Facilitate collaboration by sharing specific collections with team members.
Promote a clean and organized workspace for managing your data analysis projects.

#### Dashboards:

Serve as visual reports, bringing together multiple related questions in a single interface.
Allow you to combine different types of visualizations (e.g., charts, tables) for comprehensive data analysis.
Provide interactive features like filtering and drilling down, allowing users to explore data in greater depth.
Can be customized to meet specific needs and preferences, including branding and layout.

#### Questions:

Represent the building blocks of data analysis, formulated as SQL queries to retrieve and transform data.
Can be simple or complex, focusing on specific data points or incorporating advanced calculations.
Once created, questions can be reused in various dashboards and collections.
Offer flexibility in analyzing data from different perspectives and creating tailored reports.

#### How they work together:

- Collections: Organize and manage your questions and dashboards.
- Dashboards: Combine related questions to present a holistic view of data.
- Questions: Form the foundation for analysis, retrieving and manipulating data.

By understanding these key components, you can leverage Metabase effectively to explore and analyze your data, leading to insightful discoveries and informed decision-making.

#### Additional Tips:

Start by creating collections to categorize your data analysis projects.
Build individual questions to address specific data points or trends.
Combine relevant questions into dashboards for comprehensive data exploration.
Leverage the interactive features of dashboards to gain deeper insights.
Utilize collections to manage access control and collaborate efficiently.
